# Photoshop Web Starters

**Starter templates for Photoshop web comps.**

Currently there’s just [one `.psd`](stater@2x.psd) with multiple art boards for desktop, tablet and mobile.

I hope to add more as time goes on.

### Column math

```text
([target-width]-([desired-column-spacing]*[desired-columns+1]))/[desired-columns]
```

For example:

```text
(1920-(40*5))/4 = 430px column width
```
